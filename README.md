# sql-challenge
Purpose: Create a new database and import multiple CSV files into the database.  Create multiple tables to store the data.  Create queries to select specific data within the newly created DB. Design an ERB sketch of the database, identifying both primary and foreign keys.

Created tables and verified the csv files imported correctly into the DB.  Ran multiple queries to extract data from the tables using joins.

Resources:  On-line search to retrieve how to comment out lines of code for documentation puposes. Found the reference to "/*" & "*/" used at the beginning and end of the area needed to be commented out.
