# sql-challenge
Utilized askBCS for clarification on the primary keys question.  It was determined that PK were not necessary for all tables; however, I reconstructed the tables to include PK for all tables.
Searched on-line how to comment out statements for notes in SQL.  Found the reference to "/*" & "*/" used at the beginning and end of the area needed to be commented out.
